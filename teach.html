                    The Edgerton Center's <a href="https://edgerton.mit.edu/for-MIT-students/student-shops/student-project-lab-4-409">Student Project Lab</a>
                    is one of my favorite makerspaces at MIT. It's one of the few spaces where any member can get 24/7 tap access, and has become more than just
                    a tinkering space. It's a community that welcomes people from every background. I began helping with the space as a <b>mentor</b> by hosting
                    open hours, where I ran shop orientations, tool trainings, and various workshops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, in the Fall of 2024, I began my role as <b>Assistant Shop Manager.</b> I hold the same responsibilities as a mentor, but also <b>recruit and train shop mentors,</b>
                    create the mentor schedule at the start of each semester, <b>manage the inventory</b> of materials, hardware, and tools, and <b>design and facilitate workshops</b>
                    during the Independent Activities Period (IAP). During the IAP of 2024, I led and assisted 10+ workshops of 6-20+ people in wood carving,
                    glass etching, and glass fusing, to teach unique crafts to the MIT community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the many things I love about this space is the mission to make learning as accessible as possible. That's why all our workshops and use of materials and tools are <b>free,</b>
                    and there is <b>no cost or requirement</b> to becoming a member of the space (besides the orientation and safety trainings). And, if anyone needs extra support on a project,
                    the Student Project Lab is happy to provide any extra materials or resources they need to complete it.

                    As an LA for the introductory electronics course, I supported students by helping them understand core circuit concepts,
                    debug circuits, and develop practical lab skills. I guided students in using oscilloscopes, power supplies, and multimeters,
                    and provided hands-on assistance with soldering, prototyping, and safe lab practices.
