                    The Edgerton Center's <a href="https://edgerton.mit.edu/for-MIT-students/student-shops/student-project-lab-4-409">Student Project Lab</a>
                    is one of my favorite makerspaces at MIT. It's one of the few spaces where any member can get 24/7 tap access, and has become more than just
                    a tinkering space. It's a community that welcomes people from every background. I began helping with the space as a <b>mentor</b> by hosting
                    open hours, where I ran shop orientations, tool trainings, and various workshops.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, in the Fall of 2024, I began my role as <b>Assistant Shop Manager.</b> I hold the same responsibilities as a mentor, but also <b>recruit and train shop mentors,</b>
                    create the mentor schedule at the start of each semester, <b>manage the inventory</b> of materials, hardware, and tools, and <b>design and facilitate workshops</b>
                    during the Independent Activities Period (IAP). During the IAP of 2024, I led and assisted 10+ workshops of 6-20+ people in wood carving,
                    glass etching, and glass fusing, to teach unique crafts to the MIT community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the many things I love about this space is the mission to make learning as accessible as possible. That's why all our workshops and use of materials and tools are <b>free,</b>
                    and there is <b>no cost or requirement</b> to becoming a member of the space (besides the orientation and safety trainings). And, if anyone needs extra support on a project,
                    the Student Project Lab is happy to provide any extra materials or resources they need to complete it.

                    and provided hands-on assistance with soldering, prototyping, and safe lab practices.

                    As construction lead, I oversaw certian build operations for a large, 3-story wooden fort. Specifically, I <b>trained my peers</b> on saws,
                    drills, and other power tools, <b>read and translated design schematics</b> into actionable tasks, <b>assigned roles,</b>
                    and ensured the structure was built accurately and safely. The entire fort was <b>built in 3 weeks</b> and taken down in 3 days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because I was also mentoring for the Ocean Engineering orientation program at the time, I brought about 20 first-year students to support the build on the first day.
                    With that surge of hands, we tripled our manpower and knocked out more work in one evening than we typically could in a full day.
