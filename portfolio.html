                    This project was for the class 16.632, Intro to Autonomous Machines. For one of the final assignments, students were tasked with programming
                    a robot to follow a line using Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) Control. We were each given an identical chassis and parts, and our role was to
                    integrate the sensors and hardware to program the robot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each robot was driven by two LDO motors, one for each wheel, and had a ball caster at the back for maneuverability and low-friction contact.

                    Nearly every Mechanical Engineering sophomore takes the class 2.007, Design and Manufacturing I. Students independently build 12"x12"x16" robots
                    to compete with each other on a gameboard to score as many points as possible on a unique gameboard. From basic electronics assembly to mill and lathe machining,
                    students gain <b>hands-on experience with design, manufacturing, and assembly.</b> 2.007 teaches not how to be a maker; but rather, an <b>engineer that applies physics principles
                    to meet design requirements.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    There were many ways to score points on the "Wicked" themed gameboard. However, my strategy for the class was to make something I would be proud of.
                    Ideally, this would be something that also scored as many points as possible, but when my attention shifted to <b>climbing the wall, which does not score any points,</b>
                    I realized that I would <b>rather make something cool and fun</b> than something that scored a single point. With this in mind, I defined my design requirements: robot climbs up the wall
                    continuously and smoothly (without swinging or erratic movements), robot can begin at the starting box and approach the wall to begin climbing, module must be able to support an estimated robot weight
                    of 5 lbs, the driving and climbing must be easily controllable with the class-provided Bilda controllers, and the climbing module must use a motor (instead of spring force) for repeatability and continuous movement.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <h2>Climbing Dynamics</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
                <p>
                    The wall I wanted to climb featured small ledges my robot could grip to haul itself up, so I made many quick-and-dirty cardboard prototypes to test different mechanisms&mdash;all featuring a claw that gripped the ledges.
                    None of the 10+ cardboard prototypes provided a solution (see two on the image right); instead, they each showed me what did not work. So, thinking this could be a linkage problem,
                    I used <a href="https://www.motiongen.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MotionGen.io</a> to simulate
                    the dynamics of different linkage systems (see farther right image for a couple of the linkage combinations I simulated).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The MotionGen rabbit hole led to another failed prototype, so I took a step back. I then realized that perhaps a <b>crank and slider mechanism</b> could be the solution: ultimately the robot needs a mechanism to pull itself up,
                    and a crank and slider mechanism could provide that linear motion to achieve that. See my first prototype of this mechanism in the image below.

                    The crank and slider mechanism combined with two passive hooks to latch onto the lower ledge of the wall <b>verified my design requirements</b>
                    because it allowed for continuous upward movement and was easily controllable. This mechanism included two crank and sliders working in tandem; let's call them the active arms, one of each side of the robot.
                    Once these arms were fully retracted, the passive hooks would hook onto the lower ledge. Then, while the active arms extend, the robot would support itself with
                    the passive hooks and the lower edges of the robot chassis to provide stability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I manufactured this mechanism by manually <b>milling</b> the delrin arms, <b>turning</b> the delrin standoffs, and <b>laser cutting</b> the other metal linkages, chassis, passive hooks,
                    and metal guides in which the delrin arms slide through. I selected delrin for the arms and metal for their guides to <b>minimize friction</b> in the mechanism.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since I wanted the active arms to work in parallel, I needed to drive them in sync, or else there could be unwanted swinging and hinder the climbing.
                    I also needed to be sure that my motors and battery could provide the necessary torque to actuate the arms and pull up the robot. This brings me to my power train.

                    I used a parallel shaft gearbox with two Bilda Torque servos in continuous mode driving the main shaft at a 2:1 gear ratio. I controlled these motors remotely using a Bilda controller.
                    I selected these motors and configuration because they were the motors that supplied the highest amount of torque that I had available, and I was somewhat constrained with my chasses.
                    I originally designed for one motor in a different configuration, so when I needed to add a second motor due to the high friction in the mechanism,
                    I was limited by the size of the chassis I had already fabricated. This was one of the many instances where I learned of the importance of <b>design for manufacturing.</b>
                    I could have designed with adding a second motor in mind, but instead I had to manufacture something after I designed it.

                <p>
                    I used timing belts and tightened them with delrin wedges to synchronize the movement of the crank and slider arms.
                    The delrin wedges prevented the pulleys from slipping during higher power moments, slight miscalculations in timing pulley distances during
                    the design process, and stretching of the belt rubber over time.

                    For the competition, all robots had to begin in a starting box on the gameboard. So, I needed my robot to be able to approach and begin climbing the wall without directly placing it there.
                    To minimize the weight of the climber bot, I designed a separate driving bot, or the "chauffeur" to drive the climber to the base of the wall. I connected these motors to the same remote controller
                    as for my climber, so I only had to use one controller for both robots.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The robot was driven by two speed servos in continuous mode, one for each wheel, and used skid steering with two delrin nubs. I turned these delrin nubs on a lathe
                    which provided sufficiently low friction so that the robot could still maneuver and move.

                    I came into MIT without any high school robotics experience, so I wanted to make the most out of this class to scratch that robotics itch. That is why I chose to climb the wall: I wanted to make something
                    that challenged me, something I was passionate about and would lead to me making something I was proud of. I poured my blood, sweat, and tears (literally) into "Beck-E,"
                    the name of my climbing bot. While some of my biggest technical lessons were about machining and design for manufacturing, my most valuable takeaways were that there was <b>no such thing
                    as a mistake&mdash;they're all learning opportunities,</b> and that when the going gets tough, it's the <b>people around you that get you going.</b> I will never forget how the biggest breakthroughs
                    came right after I felt I was at my lowest. In many of those moments, all it took was someone believing in me and saying, "What?! You can't give up, I want to see that robot climb! How can I help you?"
                    And for that, I would not be able to talk about my robot without thanking the 2.007 staff that helped me brainstorm, troubleshoot, and fabricate my robot. Thank you Kait, Andy, Bill, Scott, all of the Pappalardo Apprentices

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I worked on a team of three to make a small, remotely operated barge capable of unloading 3D printed barrels onto a stationary dock.
            This was the final project for the class <i>2.00A, Designing for the Future: Earth, Sea, and Space.</i>
            Our design requirements were that the barge had to be buoyant and maneuverable in water, capable of attaching and securing itself to the dock,
            remotely operated, and able to successfully unload its “payload,” which consisted of small 3D-printed barrels.
        </p>
        <p>
            We used neodymium magnets to attach to the dock, milled foam for our catamaran floatation method,
            attached seaperch motors for propulsion and maneuvering,
            and made a servo-controlled rack and pinion system for the mechanical operation of the ramp.

                <p>
                    I designed and fabricated the rack and pinion mechanism that mechanically raises and lowers the ramp
                    to unload the payload. The system was powered by a Bilda Servo.
                    Plywood was used for base and border of the rack, which slid through a groove carved into the wood using a bandsaw.
                    The rack and pinion gears were supplied by the class, and I was responsible for integrating the mechanism into the barge.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I fabricated a passive speaker to amplify music from a regular phone speaker as part of an introduction to
            basic fabrication techniques for the class <i>2.00A, Designing for the Future: Earth, Sea, and Space.</i>
            The design requirements were to amplify sound passively and have at least one 3D printed part, one laser-cut part,
            and use at least one fastener. I also utilized a CNC milling machine, with the assistance of shop staff,
            to carve my desired shape of the speaker.
        </p>

        <p>The following slides were used for the project's presentation. They show my fabrication process and key takeaways.</p>

        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>
            For the class 2.678, <i>Electronics for Mechanical Engineers I,</i> my class partner and I had to code
            a line following robot for our final project. The robot chassis and electronic parts (including the development board seen
            in the image) were supplied by the class; we were just in charge in integrating the sensors and coding the line follower.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project culminates in a final competition, and my partner and I scored 4th place (with only 0.6 seconds away from third).
            We did not use PID control for our robot; rather, we used a simplified form of proportional control.

            I experimented with printer and curing settings while printing an army of penguins, a chubby dino, and many articulated animals, such as the capybara
            shown below. The purpose of printing these models was to learn about SLA 3D printing, so I got the CAD files of these figures from Thingiverse. The first image of the

            A shoe rack kept my shoes from piling up outside my door. A shelf decluttered my desk by giving me space for my plants.
            And the bench served as an extra seat, a low table when I wanted to work on the floor, and a stool for reaching higher shelves.

                <p>My sophomore-year dorm room was a double room (meaning it was meant for two people) and featured a concrete wall separating
                    the two halves of the room. So, my roommate and I thought it would be a great idea to build a door in the doorway-shaped concrete passage
                    that separated each of our halves. I built the frame out of upcycled wood and then installed a door I acquired from the reuse mailing list
                    (a mailing list where people post free and unwanted items).

                <p>To keep my shoes from accumulating outside my door, I built this shoe rack,
                    and it now provides a place for 6-7 pairs of shoes. I used scrap pieces of wood found in my dorm's woodshop.
                    I was used to using impact drivers in wood projects, but realized that was what was causing every thin plank of wood to split.
                    So I learned that slowly drilling pilot holes and then slowly drilling in the hardware did the trick!

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I made this wooden cat wall decor as part of Cruftmas, <a href="https://ec.mit.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Second_West" target="_blank">Putz's</a>
                    annual holiday party where people make gifts for each other (Putz is a living community I'm a part of).
                    Over the course of 30 hours, I manually fabricated this 3 foot wide cat. It took me 30 hours because I made many mistakes,
                    and had stubbornly decided I wanted to fabricate it all manually.

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5 col-md-7">
                <p>After brainstorming how the cat would look like in my notebook, I sketched my desired shape onto a large piece of plywood.
                    I then went to the bandsaw and cut out the outline. This was the largest project I had ever used the bandsaw for;
                    I actually had to find a shop that had a large enough bandsaw for this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make the Pi Tau Zeta letters (the symbols representing Putz) visible, I first traced the letters and defined what I wanted to cut out.
                    Next, I drilled an access hole and many relief holes at each corner and sharp turn, and then used a jigsaw to get the internal cutouts.
                </p>
            </div>

                    The cat was almost complete... But I felt like it was missing something. It felt too light, too flat against the wall.
                    So, I thought the best solution would be to add some wood to space it away from the wall. In retrospect, this could have easily
                    been achieved by adding a few blocks of wood, perhaps six for each corner of the cat (one for each foot, and one for the tail and head).
                    However, in the moment, I thought the best solution would be to cut pieces of wood that follow the cat's outline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, all traced and cut (with a bandsaw) by hand. Since I did not have one large thick plank of wood that was 3x3 ft,
                    I had to trace and cut many smaller pieces of wood. I then fixed all these smaller pieces to the frame of the cat with wood screws.

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-7 col-md-9">
                <p>
                    After fastening the puzzle of small wooden pieces to the cat's frame, the final step was to paint it.
                    This was also tedious because many nooks and crannies made it difficult to get paint in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many hours could have been saved if I had digitally fabricated part of the cat, such as using CAM for the cat's frame,
                    instead of drawing and using the bandsaw by hand. And although tracing the cat's shape onto several smaller pieces of wood
                    and then screwing it all together ended in a very clean-looking cat, it was not worth the extra time, effort, and material it used.
                    I am happy I developed my manual fabrication skills, but I realized that I could have reached a similar outcome with less time and
                    effort had I taken a moment to step back, think, and brainstorm a little more.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                I wanted to practice some of the skills I learned in the pilot woodworking training (the cutting board training)
                by making a wooden puzzle. I thought this would be a fun gift for someone who likes puzzles.
                I did not come up with this design; I used Steve Ramsey's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KkjFKGAo7E">free design.</a> Although the puzzle is tricky to disassemble,
                the fun lies in assembling the pieces. When disassembled, the pieces spell out "COG" which is why this is called the "COG" Puzzle.
            </p>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                I used a bandsaw to cut down the size of the basswood pieces and then learned how to use a scroll saw to cut the internal profile of the COG pieces.
                I smoothened the outside edges using a planar, and chiseled the inside to get the perfect sliding yet snug fit for the puzzle.
                The finishing touches were sanding and applying the dark brown wood finish and wax.

                    I was inspired when one of my professors for the class 2.007, <i>Design and Manufacturing I</i>,
                    told us about how he made his wife's wedding ring. I was also developing my machining skills in this class,
                    so turning a ring felt like a great way to make a gift for a friend while developing my proficiency at the lathe.
                    I chose to use stainless steel, to avoid oxidation and not have to anodize the ring. I like the look of a steel ring,
                    so I also did not want to powder coat the ring. This little project took about 5 hours to complete,
                    with 60% of the time being spent on sanding to achieve the smoothest and shiniest finish possible.

                    At first, I thought that carving a wooden bear would be a nice and easy Valentine's day gift. Although it did make for a lovely gift,
                    it was much more challenging than expected. It required a lot of patience and attention to detail, and an awareness of how the wood might behave
                    (such as knowing the direction of the grain and how the wood type affects the carving). These challenges made me fall in love with the craft,
                    so of course, I couldn't stop after just making a bear...

                <p>
                    This wooden bear was made using only a chisel and mallet. I did not have a drawing or guide or even a plan in mind.
                    I am grateful to the shop staff in Metropolis, one of MIT's many makerspaces, where I was advised to clamp my workpiece
                    and was given other tips on how to properly and safely use a chisel. My only goal was to make a bear, so even though I accidentally
                    chiseled off one of the bear's ears, he still looked like a bear, so I accomplished my mission!

                <p>
                    This time, I followed an introduction to wood carving guide to make this owl, and used various knives instead of a chisel.
                    Although I used basswood (a soft wood that is great for beginners and is very forgiving for cutting against the grain),
                    I paid special care and attention to carving along the grain. I experimented with different knives and learned the basic types of cuts.
                    This was a more tedious project than the bear because of the many small details (such as the wings, feathers, and facial features),
                    so I really enjoyed it!

                <p>I figured that making wooden whistles would be a fun way to further my wood carving skills. However, despite researching the acoustics
                    of whistles, I have yet to make a loud and clear whistle. So far, my most successful whistle sounds like a 5 year old learning how to whistle.
                    But I have not given up. The project is on pause, it's not over yet.

                    I followed a guide to make these small wooden flowers as a way to practice carving off small strips of wood at a time.
                    If I took off too much wood, the petal would be too straight and stiff, lacking the distinct curve of a petal. But if I took off too little wood,
                    then I would simply be shaving off wood and the petal would fall off.

                    I love working with glass. Lampworking, or flameworking, is a glass art technique where an artist uses a torch to melt glass rods and tubes,
                    which are then shaped using gravity and tools to create beads, figurines, marbles, and other decorative objects.
                    Although I have only made marbles and flower pendants, I want to make glass animals the next time
                    I find myself behind the burners. The pictures above are just a few examples of some of the glass marbles and flower pendants I have made.
                    More often than not, I gift the marbles and pendants I make to family and friends.
