        <h2>About</h2>

        <p>This was a fun robotics project where I built a line-following bot. Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
            It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
            release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I worked on a team of three to make a small, remotely operated barge capable of unloading 3D printed barrels onto a stationary dock.
            This was the final project for the class <i>2.00A, Designing for the Future: Earth, Sea, and Space.</i>
            Our design requirements were that the barge had to be buoyant and maneuverable in water, capable of attaching and securing itself to the dock,
            remotely operated, and able to successfully unload its “payload,” which consisted of small 3D-printed barrels.
        </p>
        <p>
            We used neodymium magnets to attach to the dock, milled foam for our catamaran floatation method,
            attached seaperch motors for propulsion and maneuvering,
            and made a servo-controlled rack and pinion system for the mechanical operation of the ramp.

                <p>
                    I designed and fabricated the rack and pinion mechanism that mechanically raises and lowers the ramp
                    to unload the payload. The system was powered by a Bilda Servo.
                    Plywood was used for base and border of the rack, which slid through a groove carved into the wood using a bandsaw.
                    The rack and pinion gears were supplied by the class, and I was responsible for integrating the mechanism into the barge.

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            I fabricated a passive speaker to amplify music from a regular phone speaker as part of an introduction to
            basic fabrication techniques for the class <i>2.00A, Designing for the Future: Earth, Sea, and Space.</i>
            The design requirements were to amplify sound passively and have at least one 3D printed part, one laser-cut part,
            and use at least one fastener. I also utilized a CNC milling machine, with the assistance of shop staff,
            to carve my desired shape of the speaker.
        </p>

        <p>The following slides were used for the project's presentation. They show my fabrication process and key takeaways.</p>

        <h2>The Project</h2>
        <p>
            For the class 2.678, <i>Electronics for Mechanical Engineers I,</i> my class partner and I had to code
            a line following robot for our final project. The robot chassis and electronic parts (including the development board seen
            in the image) were supplied by the class; we were just in charge in integrating the sensors and coding the line follower.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project culminates in a final competition, and my partner and I scored 4th place (with only 0.6 seconds away from third).
            We did not use PID control for our robot; rather, we used a simplified form of proportional control.

            I learned how to set up and use the Anycubic Photon M3 MAX and Saturn 4 Ultra resin printers with ABS-like resin to fulfill Campos Engineering’s prototyping needs.
            I experimented with printer and curing settings while printing an army of penguins, a chubby dino, and many articulated animals, such as the capybara
            shown below. The purpose of printing these models was to learn about SLA 3D printing, so I got the CAD files of these figures from Thingiverse. The first image of the
            parts in the UV curing container were parts for Campos Engineering's Water Warrior project.

            My wooden furniture projects aren’t designed to be pretty; they’re meant to solve problems.
            The door I built for my sophomore-year dorm room added an extra layer of privacy between my roommate and me.
            A shoe rack kept my shoes from piling up outside my door. A shelf decluttered my desk by giving me space for my plants.
            And the bench served as an extra seat, a low table when I wanted to work on the floor, and a stool for reaching higher shelves.

                <p>My sophomore-year dorm room was a double room (meaning it was meant for two people) and featured a concrete wall separating
                    the two halves of the room. So, my roommate and I thought it would be a great idea to build a door in the doorway-shaped concrete passage
                    that separated each of our halves. I built the frame out of upcycled wood and then installed a door I acquired from the reuse mailing list
                    (a mailing list where people post free and unwanted items).

                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>I made this wooden cat wall decor as part of Cruftmas, <a href="https://ec.mit.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Second_West" target="_blank">Putz's</a>
                    annual holiday party where people make gifts for each other (Putz is a living community I'm a part of).
                    Over the course of 30 hours, I manually fabricated this 3 foot wide cat. It took me 30 hours because I made many mistakes,
                    and had stubbornly decided I wanted to fabricate it all manually.

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-5 col-md-7">
                <p>After brainstorming how the cat would look like in my notebook, I sketched my desired shape onto a large piece of plywood.
                    I then went to the bandsaw and cut out the outline. This was the largest project I had ever used the bandsaw for;
                    I actually had to find a shop that had a large enough bandsaw for this project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To make the Pi Tau Zeta letters (the symbols representing Putz) visible, I first traced the letters and defined what I wanted to cut out.
                    Next, I drilled an access hole and many relief holes at each corner and sharp turn, and then used a jigsaw to get the internal cutouts.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    The cat was almost complete... But I felt like it was missing something. It felt too light, too flat against the wall.
                    So, I thought the best solution would be to add some wood to space it away from the wall. In retrospect, this could have easily
                    been achieved by adding a few blocks of wood, perhaps six for each corner of the cat (one for each foot, and one for the tail and head).
                    However, in the moment, I thought the best solution would be to cut pieces of wood that follow the cat's outline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course, all traced and cut (with a bandsaw) by hand. Since I did not have one large thick plank of wood that was 3x3 ft,
                    I had to trace and cut many smaller pieces of wood. I then fixed all these smaller pieces to the frame of the cat with wood screws.

                <p>
                    After fastening the puzzle of small wooden pieces to the cat's frame, the final step was to paint it.
                    This was also tedious because many nooks and crannies made it difficult to get paint in.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many hours could have been saved if I had digitally fabricated part of the cat, such as using CAM for the cat's frame,
                    instead of drawing and using the bandsaw by hand. And although tracing the cat's shape onto several smaller pieces of wood
                    and then screwing it all together ended in a very clean-looking cat, it was not worth the extra time, effort, and material it used.
                    I am happy I developed my manual fabrication skills, but I realized that I could have reached a similar outcome with less time and
                    effort had I taken a moment to step back, think, and brainstorm a little more.

            <p>
                I wanted to practice some of the skills I learned in the pilot woodworking training (the cutting board training)
                by making a wooden puzzle. My boyfriend likes puzzles, so I thought it would be a fun gift.
                I did not come up with this design; I used [insert link]'s free design. Although the puzzle is tricky to disassemble (SPELLING?),
                the fun lies in assembling the pieces. When disassembled, the pieces spell out "COG" which is why this is called the "COG" Puzzle. <!--FIX CHECK SPELLING-->
            </p>
            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                I used a bandsaw to cut down the size of the basswood pieces and then learned how to use a scroll saw to cut the internal profile of the COG pieces.
                I smoothened the outside edges using a planar, and chiseled the inside to get the perfect sliding yet snug fit for the puzzle.
                The finishing touches were sanding and applying the dark brown wood finish and wax.

                    I was inspired when one of my professors for the class 2.007, <i>Design and Manufacturing I</i>,
                    told us about how he made his wife's wedding ring. I was also developing my machining skills in this class,
                    so turning a ring felt like a great way to make a gift for my boyfriend while developing my proficiency at the lathe.
                    I chose to use stainless steel, to avoid oxidation and not have to anodize the ring. I like the look of a steel ring,
                    so I also did not want to powder coat the ring. <!-- fix this sentence double check-->
                    This little project took about 5 hours to complete, with 60% of the time being spent on sanding to achieve the smoothest and shiniest finish possible.

                At first, I thought that carving a wooden bear would be a nice and easy Valentine's day gift. Although it did make for a lovely gift,
                it was much more challenging than expected. It required a lot of patience and attention to detail, and an awareness of how the wood might behave
                (such as knowing the direction of the grain and how the wood type affects the carving). These challenges made me fall in love with the craft,
                so of course, I couldn't stop after just making a bear...

                    This wooden bear was made using only a chisel and mallet. I did not have a drawing or guide or even a plan in mind.
                    I am grateful to the shop staff in Metropolis, one of MIT's many makerspaces, where I was advised to clamp my workpiece
                    and was given other tips on how to properly and safely use a chisel. My only goal was to make a bear, so even though I accidentally
                    chiseled off one of the bear's ears, he still looked like a bear, so I accomplished my mission!
